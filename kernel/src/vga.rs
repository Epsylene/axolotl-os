// The VGA text mode was introduced by IBM in 1987 to print
// characters to the screen, by writing to a special region of
// memory, the VGA buffer. This is a 2D array, of tipically
// 25x80 cells, which is directly rendered to the screen; each
// cell is 2 bytes long, such that:
//  - Bits 0-7 encode the page 437 (an extended ASCII set) code
// point;
//  - Bits 8-11 the foreground color of the character; 
//  - Bits 12-14 its background color; 
//  - Bit 15 either a fourth background bit or a flag to set
// blinking.
//
// The VGA buffer is located at the physical address 0xb8000,
// and uses memory-mapped I/O (MMIO), a method which uses the
// same address space for both memory and I/O devices. This
// means that writing to the VGA buffer is equivalent to
// writing to the screen.

// There is a total of 16 different color, that come from the
// combination of 8 base colors from the first 3 bits with a
// 4th "bright" bit (for example, 0000 for black and 1000 for
// dark gray, 0001 for blue and 1001 for light blue, etc). The
// repr(u8) attribute tells the compiler to represent the
// internal fields as u8 values, since the layout is not
// guaranteed by Rust by default.

// cause any thread trying to acquire a resource to simply wait
// in a loop ("spin") while repeatedly checking whether the

// is not efficient since the spinning threads are wasting CPU
// cycles, but they avoid the overhead from OS rescheduling or
// context switching, so they are useful if threads are likely
// to be blocked for only short periods. The `spin` crate
// provides a no_std implementation of spinlocks, allowing us
// to safely mutate the Writer instance.
